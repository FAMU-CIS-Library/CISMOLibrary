## Overview
### Description
The library of books in the academic adviser's office is currently kept track of via pencil and paper. As a department full of tech students we should bring the library into the 21st century and allow our library to be tracked electronically. The app will show the catalog of books and show their availability as well as letting students use their student accounts to checkout the books to and from the library.
